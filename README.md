# Purpose Of Application 
The purpose of my application is to provide an android user a application that allows them to view the average temperature for the week and also provide them with more detailed information about the weather on each day of the week.

# Explanation of my application 
My application consist of 3 main pages. The first page is presented with a bright blue home page, an image and also two buttons, the first button is used to transpot the user to the second page of the application and the second button allows the user to close the application. The second page of my application presents the user with the weekly weather temperatures, 3 buttons and a blue sky background with clouds. The first button allows the user to help calculate the average temperature of the week by using a looping function and combinding all the temperatures and dividing them by 6.The second button which is called daily views allows the user to go to the third and final page of the application. The user is also presented with a third and final button which allows the user to close the application. The third and final page of the application provides the user with detailed insigts of the weather allowing the user to see the minimum temperature, the maximum temparature and the daily conditions for the week. They are also presented with a button that allows the user to go back to the home page of the application. 

# Utilisation of github and github actions 
To make sure my code works on more platforms than just my local machine, I'll be using GitHub Actions to expedite the testing process. Through the use of GitHub Actions, I want to confirm that the program runs without a hitch on my PC as well as a variety of other computers, including mobile devices. Furthermore, GitHub is a great resource for preserving the application's dependability and guaranteeing a positive user experience. It fosters continuous improvement by offering a collaborative area where problems can be recorded, defects can be reported, and upgrades can be offered. Furthermore, GitHub will be essential in providing thorough reports that outline the application's goals and features. These reports will elucidate the application's objectives, features, and implementation procedures, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding for both developers and end-users alike. Through GitHub's robust capabilities, I aim to enhance the reliability, usability, and transparency of the application, ultimately enriching the overall development and user experience.
